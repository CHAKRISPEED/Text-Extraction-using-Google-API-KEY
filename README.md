# Text-Extraction-using-Google-API-KEY
This project focuses on extracting text from the input. The front end of the project is created using Streamlit. 
There are two files - app.py and Pdf.py - which can be used for extracting text from images and PDFs respectively. Both files use Google_API_Key and PyMuPDF libraries for text extraction.

To use the project, you need to enter your own GOOGLE_API_KEY in the .env file. If you don't have one, you can create it by visiting the link below: https://ai.google.dev/. Make sure to install all the required libraries from the requirements.txt file before using the project.
